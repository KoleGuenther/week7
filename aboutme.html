				<h2>Kole Guenther</h2>
				<p class="about-intro">Hey! My name is Kole Guenther. I was originally born in a small town (small enough to be considered a village by google) in New York, and I moved to Florida when I was 7! I mainly live in Orlando but right now I am going to college in St. Louis, MO since I got the amazing oppurtunity to play Esports for UHSP and the scholarship was too high to pass up :) I am a Data Science student here who is also pursuing a minor in Computer Science! </p>

				<h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
				<p>My Favorite Hobby is easily cooking, its such a creative and free-spirited way to express myself but also lets me eat and enjoy the whole procress :) Three of my favorite things to make are Steak, Parmesan Crusted Chicken, and Fettuccine Alfredo. I also love frying stuff, although I am quite new at that, I made my own chicken nuggets and Fried Pickles recently when I was back in Florida and that was so much fun! and delicious :) </p>

				<h3>Another small hobby of mine</h3>
